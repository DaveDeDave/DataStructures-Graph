This is a basic implementation of the graph data structure in c. This project is provided with a series of tests and doxygen documentation.

## Compile and run test
Move to the project folder and the type on your terminal:
> $ make
>
> $ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./bin/graphTest

## Generate doxygen documentation
Move to the project folder and the type on your terminal:
> $ doxygen doxygen
